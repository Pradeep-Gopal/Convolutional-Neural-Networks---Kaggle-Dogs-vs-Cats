# Convolutional-Neural-Networks---Kaggle-Dogs-vs-Cats
Data classification is the process of sorting and organizing data into categories so that it is easier for us to retrieve and use this data anytime in the future. As per our problem statement, we are required to classify the given data as dogs and cats. This classification is to be performed using Convolution Neural Networks. Convolution network is a type of artificial neural network which uses the concept of perceptrons for supervised learning to analyze data. A convolution layer has an input layer, output layer, and some hidden layers which consists of convolution layers that uses a mathematical model to pass on the results to successive layers. In the given data set, we have 12500 testing data and 25000 training data that consists of dogs and cats. The training data is labeled and follows the format of dog/cat.0.jpg whereas testing data is unlabeled and the format is 0.jpg and so on.
